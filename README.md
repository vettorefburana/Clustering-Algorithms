# Clustering-Algorithms

Implement and compare different clustering algorithms: 

* K-means
* K-medoids
* Gaussian Mixture Models
* Agglomerative hierarchical clustering

The selected algorithms are applied to the Boston Housing dataset (1978)

The R code for the implementation is in "clustering.R" and the results are detailed in "report_clustering.pdf"
