# Clustering-Algorithms

The code in this repository ("clustering.R") implements and compares different clustering algorithms: 

* K-means
* K-medoids
* Gaussian Mixture Models
* Agglomerative hierarchical clustering

The selected algorithms are applied to the Boston Housing dataset (1978).

All results are detailed in the file "report_clustering.pdf".
